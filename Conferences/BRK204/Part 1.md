Here are the important issues discussed in the text, broken down into key topics:

# 1. Introduction of .NET MAUI and a Real-World Use Case:

* The session focuses on clients and Mobile Application Development with .NET MAUI.
* Irth Solutions, a company using .NET MAUI to modernize their mobile apps, is introduced through their CTO, Rod Ball.
* Rod Ball explains their application helps field workers manage and prioritize tasks based on risk and due dates.
* Irth Solutions previously used Xamarin and WPF and chose .NET MAUI to unify their codebase and share more code.
* They showcased their app's features, including task lists, map integration, and details view.

# 2. .NET MAUI Adoption and Development Experience:

* Irth Solutions was an early adopter of .NET MAUI and has seen consistent improvements and fixes since its GA at Build last year.
* They use Visual Studio on both Windows and Mac for development.
* They leverage various packages and tools, including Esri's ArcGIS maps SDK, Telerik controls, BrowserStack for testing, and **Azure** for their backend.
* A key benefit they highlight is the ability to develop for iOS, Android, and Windows in one location, simplifying the development process.
* The single project structure of .NET MAUI is seen as a significant advantage for managing libraries, screens, and assets.
* They utilize platform-specific folders for platform-dependent code.

# 3. Future Plans with Blazor Hybrid:

* Irth Solutions plans to implement dynamic forms rendering using **Blazor Hybrid**.
* This will allow business users to design forms in a web application and render them natively within the mobile app.
* This is seen as a significant improvement over their current WebView implementation.

# 4. Production and Publishing Status:

* The Irth Solutions **.NET MAUI** apps are already available in app stores.
* They are currently working with customers to roll out the new app to field users and have received positive feedback.

# 5. Key Advantages of .NET MAUI Highlighted:

* Single project structure.
* Single architecture.
* .NET for mobile, desktop, and hybrid development.
* Blazor Hybrid for leveraging web skills.
* Ability to build native experiences with offline functionality and platform integrations.
* The new handler architecture for easier workarounds and layouts.

# 6. .NET MAUI Community and Growth:

* Numerous companies are now using .NET MAUI (logos shown).

* .NET MAUI is currently the most active .NET Foundation project in terms of issues, pull requests, and contributors.
* A callout and thank you were given to .NET MAUI contributors.

# 7. .NET 7 and Visual Studio Performance:

* .NET 7 has brought speed and smaller application sizes.

# 8. Engagement and Feedback:

* The Maui PM team (Beth and Becky) are moderating a Pubble session for polls and questions via a QR code.
* Due to time constraints, there will be no live Q&A, but the team will be available in the hallway afterward.

# In summary

the important issues covered are the successful adoption of .NET MAUI by a real-world company, the benefits and development experience they've had, their future plans with Blazor Hybrid, the current production status of their apps, the key advantages of .NET MAUI, the growth and activity of the .NET MAUI community, and improvements in .NET 7 and Visual Studio.
